# Contribution policies

The repo contains plain Jupyter notebooks that contain examples and important insights concerning the fundamentals of quantum computing. Therefore, contribution requires upload of a blog-post-like Jupyter notebook that is consistent with the course curriculum. The contributions are subject to logical consistency, conceptual accuracy, and pertinence. Any added jupyter notebook should correspond to a clear topic, stated in the ```README.md```, with an index number. The name of the upload should be ```lec_idx.ipynb```, where ```idx``` denotes the index of the topic in the README.

If you believe an important lesson is missing from the curriculum, feel free to comment in the issues, and QC-FEM will evaluate your suggestion.
